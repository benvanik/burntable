Requires Chrome 14+ (probably)

Must enable Experimental Extension APIs in about:flags (and relaunch)

Don't try having multiple music services open at once - I'm not quite sure what will happen

Supported services:

  * turntable.fm (HTML5, Flash)
  * grooveshark (Flash, maybe HTML5)
  * pandora (Flash, maybe HTML5)
  * google music (Flash, maybe HTML5) - needs work, filenames get overridden to stream.mp3
